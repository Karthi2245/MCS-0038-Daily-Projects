MySql:
--> It is a Realtional Database Management System
	-->  These databases are categorized by a set of tables where data gets fit into a pre-defined category.
--> open Source
--> Ideal for both small and large applications.
--> Free
--> Very Fast and reliable and easy to use.
--> Developed by Oracle
--> Cross-platform

who uses Mysql:
--> Huge websites like Facebook, Twitter, Airbnb, Booking.com, Uber, GitHub, YouTube, etc.
--> Content Management Systems like WordPress, Drupal, Joomla!, Contao, etc.
--> A very large number of web developers around the world.

Show Data On Your Web Site
--> To build a web site that shows data from a database, you will need:

--> An RDBMS database program (like MySQL)
--> A server-side scripting language, like PHP
--> To use SQL to get the data you want
--> To use HTML / CSS to style the page

SQL:
SQL is the standard language for handling the dealing with Relational database.
SQL is used to insert, update, search , delete, database records.

How to use SQl:
--> select * from table_name - this command is for select all the records of given table_name
--> no case sensitive select is same as SELECT
--> some relational database need semicolan end of the command or statement
Important Commands:
SELECT - extracts or retrieve data from a database
UPDATE - updates data in a database
DELETE - deletes data from a database
INSERT INTO - inserts new data into a database
CREATE DATABASE - creates a new database
ALTER DATABASE - modifies a database
CREATE TABLE - creates a new table
ALTER TABLE - modifies a table
DROP TABLE - deletes a table
CREATE INDEX - creates an index (search key)
DROP INDEX - deletes an index(according to key)

My SQL SELECT:
--> The SELECT statement is used to select data from database.
--> The data returned is stored in a result table, called result-set.

to select particular data, 

SELECT colum1, colum2, colum3, FROM table_name

to select the whole data in the table,

SELECT * FROM table_name  (* denotes all)

SELECT DISTINCT:
--> This statment is used to return only distinct values(different values).
--> It will sort the duplicate values of column of the table.

with SELECT DISTINCT:
--> with this statement we can particular columns data and we can avoid its duplicate values.
--> using SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT column_name) FROM  table_name we can count the values also.

My SQL WHERE Clause:
--> The where is used to filter the records
--> it is used to extract those records which satisfy the specific condition

Syntax:
SELECT colum1 FROM table_name WHERE condition ;
--> WHERE Clause is not only used in SELECT and also used in UPDATE and DELETE statments.

Operators used in WHERE Clause:
--> = 		Equal	
--> >		Greater than	
--> <		Less than	
--> >=		Greater than or equal	s
--> <=		Less than or equal	
--> <>		Not equal. Note: In some versions of SQL this operator may be written as !=	
--> BETWEEN	Between a certain range	
--> LIKE	Search for a pattern	
--> IN		To specify multiple possible values for a column

MySQL AND, OR, NOT:
--> WHERE Clause is combined with AND OR NOT operators
--> AND OR operators used to filter the records based one or more condition
	--> The AND condition displays the record if all the condition seperated by AND is TRUE
	--> The OR condition displays the record if all the condition seperated by OR is TRUE.
--> NOT - The NOT condition displays the record if the condition is NOT TRUE

Syntax:
--> SELECT column1, column2, column3 FROM table_name WHERE condition1 AND condition2 AND condition3 ;
--> SELECT column1, column2, column3 FROM table_name WHERE condition1 OR condition2 OR condition3 ;
--> SELECT column1, column2 FROM table_name WHERE condition1 NOT condition2

MySQL ORDER BY Keyword:
--> This Keyword used to store the result set either in ascending order or descending order
--> By default the result will be ascending(ASC) order only.if we want descending we have to use (DESC).

Syntax:

SELECT coulmn1, column2 FROM table_name ORDER BY column1, column2  ASC|DESC
